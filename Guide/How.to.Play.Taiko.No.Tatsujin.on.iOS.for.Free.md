Fortunately, there is a way to play Taiko No Tatsujin on your iOS device for free and without any restrictions. All you need is a cracked IPA file of the app and a tool to install it on your device. In this article, we will show you how to do that step by step.
 
## What is an IPA file?
 
An IPA file is an application archive file that contains the binary code and resources of an iOS app. You can think of it as a zip file that contains everything you need to run an app on your device. Normally, you download IPA files from the App Store or Apple Arcade and install them automatically. However, you can also download IPA files from other sources and install them manually using a tool like Cydia Impactor or AltStore.
 
## What is a cracked IPA file?
 
A cracked IPA file is an IPA file that has been modified to bypass the DRM (digital rights management) protection of the app. This means that you can install and run the app without having to pay for it or sign in with your Apple ID. Cracked IPA files are usually created by hackers or modders who want to share their apps with others for free or add extra features to them.
