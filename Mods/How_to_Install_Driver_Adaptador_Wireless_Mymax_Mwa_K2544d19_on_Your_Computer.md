### Troubleshooting Tips
 
If you encounter any problems while installing or using your wireless adapter, here are some tips that may help:

- Make sure that your wireless adapter is compatible with your computer's operating system. The driver we provided is for Windows 10 only. If you have a different operating system, you may need to find a different driver or use a different wireless adapter.
- Make sure that your wireless adapter is plugged in securely and correctly. If it is an external device, make sure that it is connected to a USB port that works. If it is an internal device, make sure that it is inserted into a PCI slot that works.
- Make sure that your wireless router is working properly and that you have a strong and stable signal. You may need to move your computer or wireless adapter closer to the router or change the router's settings or channel.
- Make sure that you have entered the correct network name and password when connecting to a wireless network. You may need to check with your network administrator or service provider if you are not sure.
- If none of these tips work, you may need to contact Mymax customer support for further assistance. You can find their contact information [here](https://www.mymax.ind.br/contato/).
