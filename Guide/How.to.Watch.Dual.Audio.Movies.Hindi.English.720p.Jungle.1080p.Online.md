If you are wondering whether Jungle Cruise is worth watching, here are some of the reviews from critics and audiences who have seen the movie:

1. **Rotten Tomatoes**: The movie has a 62% rating from critics and a 92% rating from audiences on Rotten Tomatoes, indicating mixed to positive reviews. The critics consensus reads: \"Its craft isn't quite as sturdy as some of the classic adventures it's indebted to, but Jungle Cruise remains a fun, family-friendly voyage.\" The audience says: \"Funny, full of action, and an all-around good time, Jungle Cruise is a ride well worth taking.\"[^1^]
2. **Roger Ebert**: The movie has a 3/4 star rating from Matt Zoller Seitz on Roger Ebert's website. He writes: \"In the pantheon of Disney movies based on Disney theme park rides, 'Jungle Cruise' is pretty goodâleagues better than dreck like 'Haunted Mansion,' though not quite as satisfying as the original 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'\" He praises the film's tight construction and prolific action scenes, but notes the lack of sexual chemistry between the leads. He concludes: \"'Jungle Cruise' is a good time at the movies that could've been a great one.\"[^2^]
3. **Metacritic**: The movie has a 49/100 score from critics and a 7.0/10 score from users on Metacritic, indicating mixed or average reviews. One user writes: \"Jungle Cruise it's an adventure that feels like the old classic Disney, but that at the same time is positive and negative. Positive for the fantasy aura, negative because it doesn't feel like anything is at stake. It offers basically the same kind of entertainment you'd expect from the park ride.\"[^3^]
4. **IMDb**: The movie has a 6.6/10 rating from over 168,000 users on IMDb, indicating generally favorable reviews. One user writes: \"Jungle Cruise is a delightfully fun adventure film that finds a compelling, if uneven, swing between old-fashioned adventure cinema and the modern blockbuster mechanics of films like Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle or the post-Pirates of the Caribbean crusades from Disney.\"[^4^]

As you can see, Jungle Cruise has received mostly positive feedback from viewers who enjoyed its humor, action, and fantasy elements. However, some critics and viewers also pointed out its flaws, such as its formulaic plot, its lack of originality, and its weak romance. Ultimately, your enjoyment of Jungle Cruise may depend on your expectations and preferences for this genre of film.
